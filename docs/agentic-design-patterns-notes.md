# Agentic Design Patterns (PDF)

## Observations
- The extracted PDF appears to be a brief announcement/marketing note rather than technical content.
- It references patterns (RAG, Reflection, Routing, Memory) but provides no concrete implementation guidance in the pages extracted.

## Applied in this repo
- No direct technical changes from this file.

## Gaps to revisit
- If a full technical version becomes available, map each pattern to an explicit module and test harness.
