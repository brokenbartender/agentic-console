# Agentic AI Report (Final) Notes

Source: iVolution/Logic Consulting report (Aug 2025) on agentic AI in MEA.

## Implemented
- Persona templates + storage to formalize role-specific agents.
- Agent type summary for reflex/goal/utility/learning/multi-agent patterns.
- Misalignment checklist focused on goal drift, deception, and shutdown resistance.
- Agent readiness framework for data architecture, integration, governance, evals, and people.

## Why
The report emphasizes multi-agent personas, interoperability, agentic RAG, and misalignment risk. These additions strengthen role clarity and governance scaffolding while preserving human oversight.
