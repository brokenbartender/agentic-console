# AI 2027 Notes

Source: AI Futures Project "AI 2027" report.

## Implemented
- Incident logging and listing to capture safety failures and regressions.
- Evaluation run logging to track test coverage before releases.
- Deployment gate checklist enforcing purpose, allowlists, recent evals, and no critical incidents.
- Red-team prompt workflow to surface misuse and security risks before shipping.

## Why
The report stresses monitoring, incident response, evaluation rigor, and staged deployment as AI capability accelerates. These changes add lightweight governance signals and a release gate within the console.
