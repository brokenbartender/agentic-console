# LLM Course Notes (OCR)

Source: new.pdf (OCR of first 5 pages)

Key takeaways:
- The document references an LLM course with three tracks: Fundamentals, Scientist, Engineer.
- Emphasis on a roadmap: architecture, attention, sampling, data prep, distributed training, monitoring, storage/chat templates, synthetic data, post-training, quality filtering.
- Suggests a hands-on path toward building and deploying LLM applications.

Implications for this app:
- Keep the architecture modular (planner/executor/verifier/retriever).
- Invest in monitoring and post-training style evaluation (eval harness, regression tests).
- Treat deployment and operations as a first-class part of the roadmap.
