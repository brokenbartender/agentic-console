# 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Notes

Source: 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report (Claude).

## Implemented
- SDLC shift summary (orchestration over implementation).
- Oversight scaling checklist (escalation + checkpoints).
- Security-first checklist (dual-use, red-teaming, constrained tools).
- Agentic surfaces summary (non-engineering use cases).
- Long-running task tracking + checkpoint updates.
- Multi-agent coding team command with security/QA roles.
- Oversight rules registry for human escalation policy.

## Why
The report highlights multi-agent coordination, long-running agents, oversight at scale, security-first architecture, and expansion to non-technical surfaces. These additions operationalize those themes inside the console.
