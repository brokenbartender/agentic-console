- Require confirmation for destructive actions
- Maintain trace logs and job history
- Record A2A communications for auditability
- Provide escalation path for high-risk tasks
- Enforce purpose tagging for autonomous runs
- Restrict tool access via path/domain allowlists
- Redact sensitive data in logs + set event retention
