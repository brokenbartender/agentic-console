# Building Agentic AI (Sample Chapters - 9780135489680)

## Highlights from the table of contents
- End-to-end RAG workflow with evidence indexing, retrieval, and SQL prompt generation.
- Systematic evaluation for retrieval, SQL generation, domain difficulty, prompt chaining.
- Agent evaluation and tool-selection metrics.
- Multi-agent workflows + agent memory experiments.
- Multimodal ingestion and coding agents.
- Production optimization + deployment considerations.

## Applied in this repo
- RAG indexing + retrieval already present; provenance + source ranking added.
- Tool selection eval and reasoning bench already in `evals/`.
- Multi-agent / reflection workflows already in `team.py` and `deep_research.py`.

## Gaps to revisit
- SQL-specific RAG workflow template.
- Structured evaluation datasets + metrics for retrieval + SQL generation.
- Multimodal ingestion beyond OCR and screenshots.
