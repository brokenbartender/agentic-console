# EECS-2025-5 Notes

Source: "System Architecture for Agentic Large Language Models" (UC Berkeley, EECS-2025-5).

## Implemented
- R2E-style repo function indexing for eval scaffolding.
- Action-space registry to track available tool affordances.
- Reflection loop command to refine answers.
- Safety checkpoints + rollback notes.
- BDI entries align with planning/intent modeling.

## Why
The thesis highlights simulation environments (R2E), reflection/planning (LEAP/TEMPERA), adaptive action spaces (Gorilla/RAFT), and system reliability (rollback and post-facto verification). These additions operationalize those concepts.
